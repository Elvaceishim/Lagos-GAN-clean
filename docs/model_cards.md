### Training Data

**Dataset:** Curated collection of African album covers and related artwork  
**Size:** 1,000-2,000 images  
**Source:** Licensed CC-BY images and ethically sourced designs  
**Preprocessing:** Resized to 256×256, center-cropped, normalized  
**Augmentations:** Horizontal flips, color jittering, rotation  

**Data Characteristics:**
- Geographic focus: Pan-African representation
- Time period: Contemporary and traditional designs
- Styles: Various African artistic traditions and modern interpretations
- Licensing: All images properly licensed for use

### Model Architecture

**Base Architecture:** StyleGAN2-ADA  
**Generator:** 
- Mapping network: 8 fully connected layers (512 → 512)
- Synthesis network: Progressive upsampling from 4×4 to 256×256
- Style modulation at each layer
- Adaptive discriminator augmentation

**Discriminator:**
- Progressive downsampling from 256×256 to 4×4
- Instance normalization
- Leaky ReLU activations

### Training Configuration

**Training Epochs:** 100  
**Batch Size:** 4  
**Learning Rate:** 0.002  
**Optimizer:** Adam (β₁=0.0, β₂=0.99)  
**Hardware:** Single NVIDIA GPU (original run); recent CPU-only experiments for 128² fine-tuning  
**Training Time:** ~24 hours (original GPU run); additional CPU-only iterations remain in progress  

### Performance Metrics

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- FID Score: 464.3 (CPU-only training @128², 200 generated samples)
- LPIPS Diversity: 0.42 (from earlier GPU run)
- Training Stability: Additional GPU training required to reach FID < 60

**Qualitative Assessment:**
- Visual Quality: High-resolution, coherent album covers
- Style Consistency: Maintains African aesthetic elements
- Diversity: Generates varied designs across different styles

### Limitations and Biases

**Known Limitations:**
- Limited to 256×256 resolution
- May not capture all regional African art styles
- Training data size constrains style diversity
- Occasional artifacts in generated images

**Potential Biases:**
- May favor certain African regions based on data availability
- Could perpetuate visual stereotypes present in training data
- Western album cover conventions may influence outputs

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Diverse dataset curation across African regions
- Regular bias assessment during development
- Clear documentation of limitations
- Community feedback integration

### Ethical Considerations

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Collaboration with African artists and cultural experts
- Respect for traditional artistic practices
- Attribution of cultural influences

**Responsible Use:**
- Clear licensing and attribution requirements
- Guidelines against harmful stereotyping
- Educational context for AI-generated content

## Lagos2Duplex - CycleGAN Model

### Model Description

**Model Name:** Lagos2Duplex CycleGAN  
**Model Type:** Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network  
**Task:** Lagos house to modern duplex transformation  
**Model Size:** ~30M parameters (G_AB + G_BA + D_A + D_B)  
**Training Resolution:** 256×256 pixels  

### Intended Use

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Conceptual architectural transformation for inspiration
- Urban planning visualization and mockups
- Educational demonstrations of architectural evolution
- Creative exploration of housing development scenarios

**Out-of-Scope Uses:**
- Construction-ready architectural plans
- Professional architectural design replacement
- Real estate valuation or assessment
- Final construction documentation

### Training Data

**Dataset:** Paired domains of Lagos houses and modern duplexes  
**Domain A (Lagos Houses):** 500-1,000 images  
**Domain B (Modern Duplexes):** 500-1,000 images  
**Source:** Street view images, real estate listings, architectural databases  
**Preprocessing:** Resized to 256×256, augmented, normalized  

**Data Characteristics:**
- Lagos houses: Various architectural periods and styles
- Modern duplexes: Contemporary Nigerian residential architecture
- Unpaired training data (no direct before/after relationships)
- Geographic focus: Lagos, Nigeria metropolitan area

### Model Architecture

**Base Architecture:** CycleGAN  
**Generators (G_AB, G_BA):**
- ResNet backbone with 9 residual blocks
- Reflection padding for edge handling
- Instance normalization
- Tanh output activation

**Discriminators (D_A, D_B):**
